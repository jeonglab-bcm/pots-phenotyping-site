# Data dictionary
Generated from the live SQLite schema by `scripts/generate_data_dictionary.py`.
The schema itself is defined in `src/pots_phenotyping/store.py`. The structure
below — tables, columns, types and row counts — comes from the schema and
cannot drift from it. The prose notes are hand-curated in the script, so a
newly added column renders with a blank note (the generator warns on stderr)
and stale note text is not detected automatically.

The database is disposable: it is rebuilt from `data/articles.jsonl` by `pots-phenotyping rebuild`, with no network access. The row counts below are only as current as the last `make report` run before the enclosing commit.

## Views

### `v_article_mechanism_flags`

One row per article with the six mechanism flags as 0/1 columns.

### `v_facet_evidence_disagreement`

and both.

### `v_facet_summary`

Per facet: articles found by query, by MeSH indexing, and by either.

### `v_loose_top_matches`

The best candidate for a term whose concept name does not contain the term.
Review these first.

### `v_mapping_review_queue`

Unreviewed candidate mappings, loose matches first.

### `v_mechanism_cooccurrence`

Distribution of how many mechanism flags articles carry. The literature-level
analogue of Angeli's patient-level overlap.

### `v_ontology_is_a_paths`

The closure joined to node labels, for readable ancestor listings.


## Files on disk

| path | tracked in git | contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data/raw/*.xml.gz` | no | Every efetch response verbatim. Re-parsing needs no network. |
| `data/articles.jsonl` | yes | One JSON object per article: the corpus itself. Compacted at the end of each harvest (deduplicated by PMID, sorted numerically) so a re-run diffs readably. Everything else under data/ is derived from it. |
| `data/db/pots_pubmed.sqlite` | no | The normalized database. Disposable. |
| `data/derived/*.tsv` | yes | Small reviewable outputs: facet counts, the relation graph and its closure, candidate mappings, corpus composition. |
| `docs/HARVEST_REPORT.md` | yes | Generated validation report for the last run. |
